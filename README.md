Setting Up the Toy Box:
You have a special area in your room (the imageContainer) where you'll play with your image toys.
You also have a special toy (a loading spinner, loader) to show while you're waiting for more toys to arrive.
You have a secret password (API key) to access a magical toy shop (Unsplash API) where you can get endless new toys (photos).

Getting New Toys:
Whenever you want to get new toys, you go to the magical toy shop (Unsplash API) and ask for 10 new toys (photos) at a time (using the getPhotos function).
You display these toys (photos) in your special area (the imageContainer) for you to play with.

Playing with Toys:
Each toy (photo) you get has a picture of something cool (an image).
You can click on a toy (photo) to see more about it (open the image's webpage).

Getting More Toys Automatically:
While you're playing with your toys, you notice that whenever you're almost done playing with the current toys, more toys arrive automatically!
This happens because you're smart and you notice when you've played with almost all your toys (when you've scrolled to the bottom of the toy box).
So, you ask for more toys whenever you're almost done playing (when you've scrolled to the bottom of the page).
